  <p>My Journey</p>

 
  <p> Winny Rikhotso</p>
  
  <p>Today I am glad I took the chance and joined codetribe because it changed my life.</p>
  
  <p>When people ask me what the value is I can honestly say its the opportunity to learn to code from scratch, for free, and to be able to work on real life projects, not theory.</p>
  
  <p>Through CodeTribe I have  an opportunity to work on a real life project which will be successfully launched and I will be proud to say one of the Apps we developed at codetribe is live on the Google Play Store.
  
    <p> Having a portfolio of Apps you worked on as evidence that you are an App developer is one big step ahead.</p>
  
    <p> CodeTribe graduates can show you what they did and continue to do instead of telling you or just adding it to our CV’s, the work we did at CodeTribe speaks for them.</p>
  
    <p> I will be happy to get a permanent position with one of the biggest IT companies in South Africa after graduating from CodeTribe.</p>
  
    <p> Having a mentor that cares while learning is a bonus, the support system at CodeTribe is amazing, there is nothing or no one who can tell you that you can’t do or achieve anything, they all speak life to you, you can do anything that you set your mind to.</p>
  
    <p> I would say it also broaden my knowledge as mLab offer courses, seminars and/or mentorship to keep the different programme members up to date on the latest industry innovations, research and trends. Staying informed about your chosen industry and its trends will help you in the long run and will put you one step ahead of the competition!</p>
  
    <p>  My extra lessons form CodeTriber:</p>
  
    <p>  Build a better resume: When you leave CodeTribe, make sure you have lots of Apps as evidence of your work. Its not about a certificate at the end but about what you can show as real work and your achievements in code. Every piece of code matters, not only the final app.</p>
    <p> Enhance your network: We all know that networking is key to the success of movers and shakers of the community! Take this opportunity and build your network. Making the right connections is critical, and joining associations gives you countless opportunities to connect on a local and sometimes even global level. For most people, creating professional relationships is important, and joining a CodeTribe allows you to have a sense of security and trust. From this you are able to support and help one another in reaching your professional goals.</p>
    <p>  Be a Leader: Professional associations such as CodeTribe gave me an opportunity to develop my skills as a leader, and this is important not only for your personal growth, but for your growth in your future firm.</p>
    <p>  Become a mentor: Giving back can be the greatest reward and benefit. Participating and helping fellow CodeTribers with code,was also a great way to grow my network and confidence.  This allowed me to use my peers as sounding boards and often made some great friends with the same interests as me.</p>
    <p> Strength in Numbers: We live in a day and age where establishing a presence in any given career field demands working long hours in the office and bringing work home when the doors close. At the end of the day, you may have ideas for cultivating partnerships, yet not feel up to shouldering all the responsibility to organize them. In a community organization, you have access to an established support system of experienced people who are motivated to get things done. Then the battle is half-won!</p>
    <p> Stay Inspired and Stay Motivated: Learn to love what you do! You may not even know that you love something, but it is important to be proactive about things you discover on the journey. Join CodeTribe and discover something new TODAY!</p>
